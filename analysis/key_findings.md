### 2️⃣ How has the home advantage changed over time?

We analyzed matches across decades:

- The effect of one's own pitch is real, but changes dynamically over decades.
- The early decades show a clear advantage (albeit with a small sample of data).
- The years 1930-1960 and 1990-2010 maintained a stable advantage of around 50-52%. 
- The decline in the 1980s may have been the result of greater professionalism of the teams and better logistics for the visitors.
- Between 2020 and 2021, the impact of the pandemic may have reduced the effect, but did not eliminate it completely.
